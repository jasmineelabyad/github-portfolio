##  Objective

To design a simplified Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) policy for protecting sensitive HR employee PII data within a critical infrastructure environment. This lab focuses on applying the Zero Trust principle of *Verify Explicitly* using identity, device posture, and network context signals.

---

##  Key Components & Concepts

1. **Policy Engine (PE):** Evaluates access requests and makes allow/deny decisions based on security signals.
2. **Policy Administrator (PA):** Translates policy decisions into actions such as granting credentials or session access.
3. **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** Enforces access decisions by allowing or blocking access to protected resources.

---

##  Core Principle Applied

**Verify Explicitly**  
Every access request to the HR Employee PII Database is evaluated using multiple real-time security signals. Access is only granted if the user’s identity is verified, the device is compliant, and the network context is trusted.
